- render seems to be working, more testing required
- gifcreator  seems to do something but functionality is probably incomplete
- update redis api from v5 to v8
- fix kubernetes manifests
- write tests
- document required env vars
- add defaults as well as error handling for the env vars
- fix actual behavior (works but the final object can't be viewed and doesn't seem to exist)
