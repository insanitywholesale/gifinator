# gifinator

fork of https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/gifinator to run locally and use minio for storage instead of gcs.
look at TODO for what's left to be done (hint: it's a lot).

# running

## env vars
all of the parts need certain environment variables to be set

## render
this one is pretty simple, set the env vars and run

## gifcreator
two instances need to be running, one in server mode and the other in worker mode

## frontend
can't be bothered with the pixel-pushing stuff for now
